[![final-collection-extract.png](https://i.postimg.cc/g2yd1xng/final-collection-extract.png)](https://postimg.cc/VJN3CL9t)

Total NFT Collection: 6000
Mint Status: SOLD OUT
Marketplaces: SolSea, Magic Eden, more soon
Rarities: RarityMon, MoonRank

Build Process:
1. Idea to make a skull motive NFT collection
2. Make sketches on paper, do research and model in professional 3D tools
3. Decide on the final design and layout to enable infinite (6000) unique combinations
4. Render all attributes in 3D 4k Resolution (Redshift, Cinema4D) and export each layer
5. Use generative art tools like Hashlips https://github.com/skullswtf/hashlips_art_engine to generate the unique DNA based art and the correspoding Metadata in JSON format
6. Use Metaplex https://github.com/skullswtf/metaplex to upload the images and data to Arweave and the Solana Blockchain (test small units in devnet, prod. on mainnet-beta costs ~5000$ in Solana for 6000)
7. Use Candy Machine to do a fair launch https://github.com/skullswtf/candy-machine-mint and host the Minting Webiste on a stable server
8. Go through a bumpy launch and sell out after < 48hrs 
9. Take a nap for 6 hrs
10. Get lised on Secondary Markets like SolSea, Magic Eden, Alpha.art and Solanart if they accept your collection
11. Release the Rarities (was step 8.1 before, which was a fair, but not a smart move)
12. Continue building a solid Roadmap that delivers on its promises...
